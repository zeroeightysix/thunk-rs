//! This crate provides functionality for thread-safe and non-thread-safe lazy
//! evaluation in Rust. It also provides functionality for generically working
//! with thunks of a given type.
//!
//! Three different owned thunk types are provided, implementing `Lazy`,
//! `LazyRef`, and `LazyMut`:
//! * `Thunk`: a non thread-safe thunk.
//! * `AtomicThunk`: a thread-safe thunk, which implements `Send + Sync`.
//! * `Strict`: a strict, non-deferred thunk which always immediately
//!   evaluates whatever computation it's given, intended for genericity over
//!   strictness.
//!
//! In addition, two shared thunk types are provided, implementing `LazyRef`
//! and `LazyShared`:
//! * `RcThunk`: a reference-counted thunk type. This is a wrapper over `Thunk`.
//! * `ArcThunk`: an atomically reference-counted thunk type. This is a wrapper
//!   over `AtomicThunk`.
